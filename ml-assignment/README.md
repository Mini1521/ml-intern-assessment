# Trigram Language Model

This directory contains the core assignment files for the Trigram Language Model.

## How to Run 
1. Instal dependencies - 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
2. Run unti tests to ensure the model is working correctly - 'pytest ml-assignment/tests/test_ngram.py'
3. Generate text using example corpus - 'cd m-assignment'
                                        'python src/generate.py'
                -> This trains the TrigramModel on the example_corpus.txt and prints generated text to the console.
